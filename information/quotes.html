            <ul>
                <li>Be Prepared... the meaning of the motto is that a scout must prepare himself by previous thinking out and practicing how to act on any accident or emergency so that he is never taken by surprise. <strong>Robert Baden-Powell</strong></li><br>
                <li>A Scout is never taken by surprise; he knows exactly what to do when anything unexpected happens. <strong> Robert Baden-Powell</strong></li><br>
                <li>A Scout smiles and whistles under all circumstances. <strong> Robert Baden-Powell</strong></li><br>
                <li>The most successful detectives owe their success to noticing small signs. Scouts are natural detectives and never let the smallest detail escape them. These small things are called by Scouts. <strong> Robert Baden-Powell</strong></li><br>
                <li>The knowledge that we have brother scouts working in the same uniform, to the same ends, in the same way, in all corners of the Empire, cannot but make scouts proud of their brotherhood, and cannot fail to bring them into closer sympathy. <strong>Robert Baden-Powell</strong></li><br>
                <li>True Scouts are the best friends of animals, for from living in the woods and wilds, and practising observation and tracking, they get to know more than other people about the ways and habits of birds and animals, and therefore they understand them and are more in sympathy with them. <strong> Robert Baden-Powell</strong></li><br>
                <li>Scoutcraft is a means through which the veriest hooligan can be brought to higher thought and to the elements of faith in God; and, coupled with the Scout's obligation to do a good turn every day, it gives the base of Duty to God and to Neighbour on which the parent or pastor can build with greater ease the form of belief that is desired. <strong> Robert Baden-Powell</strong></li><br>
                <li>In assisting his 'neighbour' every day to the best of his ability, and keeping truth, honesty, and kindness perpetually before him, the Boy Scout, with as little formality as possible, is pleasing God. <strong> Robert Baden-Powell </strong></li>

            </ul>
